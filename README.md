# action-publish-subrepo-test-monorepo

Repo for testing the [action-publish-subrepo](https://github.com/cucumber/action-publish-subrepo/) GitHub Action.

Since that action's job is to copy code from one repo to another, we use this repo as the source (where the action is run) and the https://github.com/cucumber/action-publish-subrepo-test-a-subfolder repo as the target.
